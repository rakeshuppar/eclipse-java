2. *JDK-Java Development Kit
         It is kit download from the internet and write the program.
		 
   *JRE-Java Runtime Environment
   
        In JRE run the program in runtime environment. 
   
   *JVM-Java Virtual Machine
        It converts byte code(intermediate code) into machine language(0,1).
		

5.          .java                                       .class

   * it is in high level langauage             *it is neither high level nor macahine level
                                                language.

   * It is Source code                         * it is intermediate code.
   
   * with extension .java                      * with extension .class
   
   * after .java we need to compile            * after.class we need to interpret
     the program                                 the program with jvm.
